*How Roundworm is Contracted*:

  

Environment—Dogs and cats can contract Roundworm when they consume worm larvae or eggs from infected feces or ground-soil where infected feces previously laid. Raw or undercooked meats.

  

Mother—Puppies and kittens can become infected during embryonic development when larvae in the mother's tissues migrate through the uterus and placenta and into the baby. Larvae can also enter the mother's mammary tissues and cause infection through nursing. And contact with infected feces during the birthing process.

  

**Important:** Roundworm is **Zoonotic!**
Zoonotic parasites can be passed from a pet, to humans. It is Recommended that Pet-Parents thoroughly sanitize their hands after handling the pet and when picking up pet feces.
